## 💡 How it Works

The webpage works by showing a series of **animated elements**:

2. **Animations**: GSAP animations are used to animate text, profile pictures, and elements like the balloons and birthday hat.
3. **Interactive Flow**: The message unfolds step-by-step, displaying birthday wishes and fun animations as the user engages with the page.
